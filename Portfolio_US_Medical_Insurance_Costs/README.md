# US Medical Insurance Costs Portfolio Project

This is my first portfolio project while taking the codeacademy Data Science Analyst Course. 
While this work is my own, I must recognize the help I received while googling questions, 
looking through stackoverflow, and teaching myself with the resources on codeacademy and 
learning from chatGPT. 

With time, I hope to use these tools for different reasons and build a better personal 
foundation. This is typical of getting comfortable with a new skill. 

### The Notebook
I used Jupyter Notebook and walked through my analysis there while also presenting my
findings. If you would like to discuss how I conducted my analysis or have a chat about
the findings, I am happy to build additional presentation materials to faciliate our 
conversation.
